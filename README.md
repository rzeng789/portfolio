# Portfolio
👋 Hi, I'm Ruilan (Helen) Zeng
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a dual-degree candidate at UC Santa Barbara pursuing a B.S. in Financial Mathematics & Statistics and a B.A. in Economics & Accounting, with international experience at Sciences Po Paris and The University of Hong Kong. My interests lie at the intersection of quantitative finance, machine learning, and data-driven decision making.

Throughout my internships and academic journey, I’ve worked on projects ranging from real estate conversion and credit fund modeling to biological data analysis and market strategy consulting. While some of my most technically advanced work—particularly involving confidential real estate conversion models and investor materials—cannot be publicly shared, I've included a few public-facing projects below to showcase my analytical workflow and modeling style.

🔍 Featured Projects

- Built NumPy/SciPy harness on 120+ random grids to probe edge behavior  
- Found natural splines flatten past domain; patched boundary logic; added unit tests

**₿ Next-Day Bitcoin Return Forecasting · R**  
- Ingested 1-min Bitstamp data to daily features, engineered lags and volumes

- Used multiple and log-transformed regression models to predict diamond prices based on carat, cut, depth, and color.
- Built and refined regression models with R² > 0.86
- Conducted Spearman correlation analysis and backward AIC-based feature selection
- Performed residual diagnostics and multicollinearity checks

🛑 Note on Confidentiality
Some of my most impactful work—particularly those involving real estate acquisitions, private equity fundraising, and credit portfolio strategies—contains proprietary financial data and cannot be publicly posted. Please reach out if you’d like to discuss these experiences further in a one-on-one setting.
